# SimpleFiles

This app is a very basic file manager made using the Gtk toolkit. It is intended to be used
on phones.

I was unhappy with the Gtk file managers available for Linux phones like the pinephone since they
aren't adapted for mobile screens yet. I threw this together so I could have something to use to easily 
do basic file/folder management while testing. BEWARE OF BUGS - Not my fault if you lose files. I'm ok
with the risk since I'm ust playing around with the phone for now.
